# OCCUPATION 2.5 GAME BY THE3DACTION MOD BY catOS

Download Mod Menu Instructions : You need to download the latest version of BepInEx from GitHub, extract and place it in the root directory of Occupation 2.5. Then, in the plugin folder, place the mod menu dll I created. Launch the game in Endless War mode and press P.

For mods creators : Create an editor folder and past this BuildBundle.cs into your Unity Project, Build Your level and update your BuildBundle.cs for your level preferences (!MAKE SUR YOUR SHADERS ARE SET TO MOBILE/BUMPED OR EQUIVALANT!).
You can create anything you want without any limits, even things new to the game (just use Astar (A*) for navigation). I might even make a dedicated SDK (Unity project) to simplify mod development and get features already present in the game, but I'm afraid some people will abuse it and steal the game's assets.
